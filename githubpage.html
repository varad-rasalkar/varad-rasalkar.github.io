                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Illinois Business Consulting, where I leverage my expertise in data-driven software engineering, automation, and cloud computing to develop innovative solutions for business challenges. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Economics with a Minor in Statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.</p>
                
                <p>My technical interests span across financial technology, risk analysis, and AI-driven automation. Through my coursework in econometrics, computer science, and statistical modeling, I have developed a strong foundation in predictive analytics and financial risk assessment. I specialize in implementing machine learning techniques such as time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, and Monte Carlo simulations to optimize financial decision-making. I have worked with Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and SQL to build data-driven models that enhance financial operations.</p>
                
                <p>At Staples, as a Software Engineering Intern, I optimized SQL queries and migrated legacy Oracle SQL databases to Snowflake, reducing query execution times by 30%. Additionally, I developed a promotional email campaign game using Python and HTML, boosting customer engagement. As a Data Science Intern at the University of Illinois Research Park, I designed real-time dashboards using Tableau and PowerBI, automated ETL pipelines, and implemented data transformations that improved accuracy across thousands of financial records.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond my academic and professional experience, I am passionate about applying AI and automation to financial markets. My work in risk analysis involves developing computational models that quantify market volatility and assess portfolio risks. I have experience with Monte Carlo simulations, stochastic modeling, and statistical arbitrage strategies, using Python (pandas, NumPy, SciPy), SQL, and cloud-based data architectures like AWS and Snowflake.</p>
                
                <p>I am always excited about new challenges that push the boundaries of data science, software engineering, and economic analysis.</p>
